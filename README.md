Result Transformers in Hibernate

The ResultTransformer is a nice and simple interface that allows you to transform any Criteria result element.

Using result set transformers we can transform the result in to java object at the time of querying. For example in the below code I am retrieving Employee name from Employee class at querying time , we are assigning the result set to Employee class.

ResultTransformer

when we query different classes and we want to cast into one class

we have to set the properties instead of that we can use setResultTransformer with new AliasToBeanResultTransformer Class
